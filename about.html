<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Computer Science student with a passion for web development and a strong desire to build user-friendly, efficient applications.

I am continuously learning and staying up-to-date with industry trends, particularly in full-stack development and cloud computing. I enjoy solving problems and am committed to growing as a developer through hands-on experience and collaboration. Although I am just starting my professional journey, I am excited about the future and ready to contribute to impactful projects.</p>
